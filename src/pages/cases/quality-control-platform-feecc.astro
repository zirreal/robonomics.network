A fixed-length key to find your file from all over the world (theoretically).")}</p>

You may not need it every time you take your favorite lavanda raf, but that one day it tastes bitter, you and the seller may be totally sure who's the culprit here.")}</p>

See, there is a medical equipment company, EndoStars, which uses manually-assembled components and those are subject to risk of defects. Prior to FEECC installation you could never tell if the defect is a supplier fault or the assembler's mistake. More than that, there were several processes yet to be optimized like providing assembly schemes in a digital form rather than searching through tons of papers.")}

With that the quality control department may be sure of the innocence of their colleagues and the assemblers may protect themselves against blame.")}
